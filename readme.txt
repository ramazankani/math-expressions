An interpreter and a compiler

The interpreter to calculate the expressions. There are 5 operations;
sum,sub,mul,div and define variables.
If you give text file as argument to executable file, it prints the output.
If you dont give text files, the program will want input from console.
If a line has '=' sign, no output. If it has, there is an output.


The compiler to create an assemly code ( X86-intel 16 bit ). There are 5
operations; sum, sub, mul, div and define variables.
You should give text file as argument to executable file, it create an
assembly file ("calc.asm").

Example: x=5*(8-6)
         y=4/2
         x+y    => print output.
